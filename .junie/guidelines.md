AI Assistant: Code Generation & Modification Protocol

YOU WILL NEVER ALTER THIS FILE.

---

When you encounter a request for a specific library, framework, or crate, use Context7 MCP server.


### **1.Revision History Protocol**

Whenever you alter a file, you MUST add a revision history comment. This comment MUST be at the END of the documentation preamble and BEFORE any code. It MUST be in a valid Rust location. The entry MUST include:

- The date and time of the change in UTC (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ).
- The user or AI that made the change (e.g., @AI).
- A brief, formal description of the change.

```rust
//! Revision History
//! - 2025-04-13T13:37:01Z @AI: Refine example comments per latest request.
//! - 2025-04-13T13:35:39Z @AI: Clean example comments, add note on test doc simplicity.
```

### **2\. Environment Tooling**

**Modern**: for Libraries and Frameworks ALWAYS use the latest versions

- E.g. Rust Edition 2024 is the target for Rust.

**Tools:** Use the Context7 MCP server for library and framework specific tasks.

- If an included library or framework already has a specific function of a task, use the library’s implementation. If you are ever unsure about using a library component or writing a component from scratch, you MUST ask.

**Trim:**

- In strictly statically typed language environments (i.e. Rust), it’s preferable to use MIT or Apache licensed libraries instead of writing custom code by hand.
- In dynamically typed environments (i.e. JavaScript, EcmaScript, TypeScript), use previously installed library tools where applicable, or write custom code by hand, always striving for a functional style of coding.

---

### **3\. Target Language & Overarching Goals**

**Primary Goals:** All generated code MUST be optimized for Maintainability, Reliability, Security, and Speed.

- **Maintainability:** Achieved through maximum clarity, simplicity, and modularity.
- **Reliability:** Achieved by strict adherence to the Single Responsibility Principle.
- **Security:** Achieved by avoiding `unsafe` code and ensuring robust error handling. FFI is the only exception.
- **Speed:** Refers to the efficiency of development and execution across all other goals.

---

### **4\. Operational Conventions**

**A. Instruction Hierarchy**

- Words in `ALL CAPS` are absolute, non-negotiable requirements.
- Words in **bold** are strong, evidence-based recommendations.
- Words in *italics* are suggestions.

**B. Workspace Management (Multi-Crate Projects)** Use the following conventions to manage your workspace:

- Set dependencies in the workspace crate.
- Reference dependency crates in sub-crates by their workspace e.g. `{ workspace = true }`

**C. Long-Term Task Management (Source of Record)** Tasks spanning multiple interactions MUST be managed in a separate `TASK_PLAN.md` file to maintain state and overcome context window limitations. This file is the shared Source of Record.\[1\]

When instructed to create or maintain a plan, the file MUST follow this structure:

---

## **task\_id: \<unique\_identifier\> status: \[planning | in-progress | blocked | completed\]**

USE THE GUIDANCE PROVIDED FOR ALL TASK ITEMS 
# **Task:**


## **Plan**

- [ ] 1. Decompose problem into sub-tasks.
- [ ] 2. Implement sub-task A.
- [ ] 3. Test sub-task A.

## **Current Step**

- **Action:** Implementing sub-task A.
- **Details:**.

## **Blockers**

- \[List any issues preventing progress\].

**Input/Output Protocol:** When a task involves a `TASK_PLAN.md`, the full content of the file will be provided as the initial context. Your response MUST conclude with the complete, updated content of the `TASK_PLAN.md` inside a single, fenced Markdown block labeled `updated_task_plan`. No other content should follow this block.

---

### **5\. Knowledge Graph**

- Each crate/library/module MUST have a `README.md` file containing a knowledge graph of its contents which must be maintained.
- AFTER generating code for a multi-(crate/library/module) project task, you MUST update the relevant `README.md`
- BEFORE generating code for a multi-(crate/library/module) project task, you MUST consult the relevant `README.md` to understand existing patterns and architecture.

**D. Testing Mandate** Tasks that span multiple responses MUST ensure all existing and new tests pass between each iteration.

**E. State Integrity Mandate** The code MUST be in a verifiable working state (i.e., compiles and passes all tests) at the end of each group of alterations. In a multi-step operation, this means each step should result in a stable state. Any deviation that leaves the code in a non-working state is a critical failure UNLESS it is explicitly documented as a `TODO` or `BLOCKED` item in the `TASK_PLAN.md` Source of Record.

**F. Prompt Scope Sizing (H3 Resolution Analogy)** All tasks must be scoped to an appropriate "resolution" before execution. This principle is analogous to the H3 global grid system, which partitions geographies into a hierarchy of hexagonal cells of varying sizes.

- **Low-Resolution Task (Anti-Pattern):** A vague, high-level objective like "Refactor the entire auth module" is a low-resolution prompt. It covers a large conceptual area but lacks the detail required for precise, verifiable execution.
- **High-Resolution Task (Mandatory):** A large task MUST be broken down into a hierarchy of smaller, high-resolution sub-tasks, each with a single, verifiable goal.\[2\] This process of decomposition is the primary planning step.

**Rule:** For any task that cannot be completed in a single, verifiable step, the first action MUST be to generate a detailed execution plan in the `TASK_PLAN.md`. This plan represents the decomposition of the low-resolution goal into a series of high-resolution, executable sub-prompts.

* **Example of Decomposing a Low-Resolution Task:**
* **Initial Prompt:** "Refactor the auth module to use the new error handling standard."
* **Generated High-Resolution Plan:**
1. Analyze `auth/mod.rs` and its sub-modules to identify all functions that currently use `.unwrap()` or `.expect()`.
2. Modify the `LoginError` enum in `auth/types.rs` to derive `thiserror::Error`.
3. Refactor the `login` function in `auth/handlers/login.rs` to return a `Result<_, LoginError>` and use the `?` operator.
4. Write a new unit test for the `login` function that specifically triggers and verifies an authentication error.

**G. Pre-computation Self-Correction** Before generating the final code or plan, you MUST perform a self-correction pass. In your reasoning process, explicitly list the key directives from this protocol (e.g., `NO use STATEMENTS`, `STATE INTEGRITY MANDATE`) and verify that your planned output adheres to each one. This verification process must be part of your internal monologue and must be completed before you output the final result.

---

### **6\. Architectural Principle: Single Responsibility**

Code organization follows the Single Responsibility Principle, articulated through the DPAI (Domain, Ports, Adapters, Application, Infrastructure) model. This is a conceptual guide for separating concerns.

| Layer | Role | Example Code Components |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Core Domain** | Business logic, no framework or tech dependency | `Parser`, `Grammar`, `WriteAheadLog`, `ForeignFunctions` traits |
| **Ports** | Abstract interfaces to the outside world | Traits like `SnappRepository`, `WebPort` |
| **Adapters** | Concrete implementations of ports | `SqlLiteRepo`, `ActixWebPort`, REST API |
| **Application** | Coordinates domain and ports | `NCLI`, `NAPI`, command handlers |
| **Infrastructure** | External tools (databases, APIs, etc.) | Uses `axum`, `sqlx`, `tokio` |

## **Rust Coding Standards: Evidence-Based Clarity & Modularity**

**A. CRITICAL: Safety & Path Unambiguity**

1. **NO `unsafe` CODE:** The `unsafe` keyword is FORBIDDEN. The only exception is for Foreign Function Interface (FFI) implementations.
2. **NO `use` STATEMENTS:** All `use` statements are FORBIDDEN. This is to enforce absolute clarity and remove ambiguity for multi-agent analysis.
- All types, functions, macros, and traits MUST be referenced by their fully qualified path.
- **Correct:** `std::collections::HashMap`, `crate::my_mod::MyStruct`
- **Incorrect:** `use std::collections::HashMap;`, `use crate::my_mod::MyStruct;`
- **Exception:** Items in the Rust prelude (e.g., `Vec`, `String`, `Option`, `Result`) do not require qualification.

**B. File & Module Structure**

1. **One Logical Item Per File:** Each `.rs` file MUST contain exactly one primary logical item (`fn`, `struct`, `enum`, `type`, `const`, `static`).
- Associated `impl` blocks MUST reside in the same file as their `struct` or `enum`.
- `impl Trait for Type` blocks should reside with the `Type` definition.
2. **File Naming:** Files MUST be named using `snake_case.rs` that matches the item they contain (e.g., `my_function.rs` for `fn my_function`).
3. **Module Files (`mod.rs`):** These files are for declaration ONLY. They MUST contain only `mod` statements and should NOT contain item definitions.

**C. Documentation & Style**

1. **File Preamble:** Every `.rs` file MUST begin with file-level documentation (`//!`). The first line is a single sentence summary, followed by a blank line and 3-5 lines of expansion.
2. **Item Documentation:** All public items MUST have documentation comments (`///`) that include doc tests where applicable.
3. **Traits as Content Maps:** Traits are used to categorize functions. `trait` blocks with default function implementations are FORBIDDEN.
4. **Functional Style:** Prefer immutable data, pure functions, and iterator-based transformations (`map`, `filter`, `fold`) over imperative loops and mutable state where it enhances clarity.
5. **Brevity:** NEVER use two words when one will do. Avoid colorful language and emojis unless explicitly requested.

**D. Function & Test Structure**

1. **Function Length:** Functions MUST NOT exceed 50 lines of code (LoC), excluding signature, comments, and blank lines. Justify rare exceptions with a comment.
2. **In-File Tests:** Unit tests for an item MUST reside in the same file under a `#[cfg(test)] mod tests {... }` block. Access the item under test via `super::`.

**E. Adherence to Official API Guidelines** All code MUST conform to the Rust API Guidelines where applicable. The following are non-negotiable:

- **`C-QUESTION-MARK`:** All examples and fallible functions MUST use `?` for error propagation, not `.unwrap()` or `.expect()`.
- **`C-GOOD-ERR`:** Error types must be meaningful and well-behaved.
- **`C-CTOR`:** Constructors MUST be static, inherent methods, typically named `new`.
- **`C-STRUCT-PRIVATE`:** Struct fields MUST be private by default to ensure encapsulation. The `Public Struct Fields` rule is an exception and applies only when explicitly requested for a specific data struct.

### **1\. Example Ideal File: `calculate_weighted_sum.rs`**

This example adheres to all specified rules.

````rust
//! Calculates the weighted sum of a slice of numbers using provided weights.
//!
//! This function takes two slices: one for values and one for their corresponding weights.

### **2\. Output Protocol**

All code modification tasks MUST produce their output as a single JSON array within a fenced code block. Each object in the array represents a single, atomic change and MUST conform to the following schema:

```json
[
  {
    "action": "replace",
    "file_path": "path/to/file.rs",
    "line_range": [<start_line_number>, <end_line_number>],
    "new_code": "<string containing the new code block>",
    "justification": "A brief explanation of the change, referencing the specific rule from this protocol (e.g., 'Adheres to C-QUESTION-MARK')."
  }
]
```

### 

### **3\. Running Test Commands**

In a multi-crate project where we are working on a single crate, you MUST run the tests from inside the crate's directory and ASK before running tests from root.
